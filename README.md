## what's up 
  * this is a compacted framwork of train and evaluate, it's aim is to make research job more and more quick and convinient, not include or include RNN or CNN.
  * more important, this project inspired from ignite and Pytorch-NLP more, sincerely to these great authors.

## how to run 
* install env 
` sh download.sh`
* start python train+val 
   
   `  python run_cnn.py`
     
   ` python  run_cnn.py  --epochs 1`
